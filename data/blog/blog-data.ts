      <h2>Welcome to the Ultimate  Guide</h2>
      <p> is more than just a running game â€“ it's a physics-based challenge that requires timing, skill, and strategy. This comprehensive guide will help you master every aspect of the game.</p>
      
      <h3>Basic Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
      <p>Understanding the core mechanics is crucial for success:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Timing is Everything:</strong> Perfect your click/tap timing to hit speed boosts at the optimal moment.</li>
        <li><strong>Physics Matter:</strong> Learn how momentum and gravity affect your character's movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Obstacle Navigation:</strong> Develop strategies for different types of obstacles and terrain.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Advanced Strategies</h3>
      <h4>Speed Boost Optimization</h4>
      <p>Speed boosts are the key to achieving high scores. Here's how to maximize their effectiveness:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Watch for visual cues that indicate upcoming boost opportunities</li>
        <li>Time your inputs to coincide with your character's natural rhythm</li>
        <li>Chain multiple boosts together for exponential speed increases</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Obstacle Mastery</h4>
      <p>Different obstacles require different approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Static Barriers:</strong> Use precise timing to jump over or slide under</li>
        <li><strong>Moving Obstacles:</strong> Predict movement patterns and plan your route accordingly</li>
        <li><strong>Terrain Changes:</strong> Adapt your strategy based on surface type and incline</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Pro Tips for High Scores</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice on easier levels to perfect your timing before attempting challenges</li>
        <li>Learn the rhythm of each track â€“ every level has its own "beat"</li>
        <li>Don't rush â€“ sometimes maintaining steady progress is better than risky speed boosts</li>
        <li>Study the leaderboards to learn from top players' strategies</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Over-clicking during speed sections (this can actually slow you down)</li>
        <li>Ignoring environmental cues that telegraph upcoming obstacles</li>
        <li>Focusing only on speed without considering positioning</li>
        <li>Getting frustrated after failures instead of learning from them</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Remember, mastering  takes practice and patience. Each failed attempt is a learning opportunity that brings you closer to that perfect run!</p>
